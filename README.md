## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a healthcare machine learning model aimed at predicting skin cancer. The model has been trained on over 5,000 images, allowing for improved diagnostic accuracy by 20%. A user-friendly web interface facilitates early detection, enabling users to upload images for analysis.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained on a large dataset to predict skin cancer with high accuracy.
- **Image Processing:** Supports the upload and processing of images for diagnosis.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with HTML and CSS for easy navigation and usability.
- **Backend Processing:** Utilizes PHP for server-side processing to handle user uploads and model predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
- **Backend:**
  - PHP
- **Machine Learning:**
  - [Specify ML framework/library used, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, etc.]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Scure
   ```

2. Set up a local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) to run PHP.

3. Place the project files in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

4. Access the project in your web browser at `http://localhost/Scure`.

## Usage
1. Open the web interface in your browser.
2. Upload an image of skin to be analyzed.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the diagnosis.
4. View the results displayed on the web page.
